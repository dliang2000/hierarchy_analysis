apache-commons-lang 3.2.1 -> 3.3 no diffs
plexus-utils 3.0 -> 3.3.0: no diffs
slf4j 1.7.29 -> 1.7.30: no diffs
jackson-annotations 2.7.0 -> 2.10.2 no diffs

apache-commons-math 3.2 -> 3.3: adds an null-deref FB infer warning in a method that is new to 3.3
jsoup 1.9.2 -> 1.10.1: new resource leak in new method
maven-scm: new NULL_DEREF in a line of new code (existing NULL_DEREFs stay)

jodatime 2.0 -> 2.10.5: 
 * we see a -1 change in simplified code which no longer has a cache and hence no THREAD_SAFETY_VIOLATION
 * also a -1 change in code whose cache got simplified and the THREAD_SAFETY_VIOLATION removed (still has a cache though)
 * 2x NULL_DEREFERNCE in equals which assumes that the target object isn't null
 * NULL_DEREFERENCE in <clinit> that got more sophisticated

ph-commons 9.0.0 -> 9.39: 75 new warnings, in both directions
 * #0 new code NULL_DEREFERENCE
 * #1 INTERFACE_NOT_THREAD_SAFE: new call to non-thread-safe method from @ThreadSafe class, though it's hidden sort of deep in the callee hierarchy
 * #2 (-1) INFERFACE_NOT_THREAD_SAFE: on a call to logging code; s_aLogger replaced with LOGGER

So in this case we'd clearly say that we think that there are signifant changes between these versions.
