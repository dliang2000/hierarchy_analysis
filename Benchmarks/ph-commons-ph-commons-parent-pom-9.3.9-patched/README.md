# ph-commons

Java 1.8+ Library with tons of utility classes required in most of ph-* projects.

Version 6.x contains major changes and more or less all other projects were released to reflect the changes of 6.x.
Version 7 does not exist.
Version 8.x was re-designed to best work with JDK 8.
So please ensure to not mix 5.x, 6.x and 8x. versions of ph-commons!

This project was the following modules:
  * ph-bc - BouncyCastle support library (since 9.1.2)
  * ph-charset - support for additional character sets (e.g. UTF-7)
  * ph-cli - library with commandline parameter definition support; loosely based on commons-cli
  * ph-collection - library with extended collection related classes
  * ph-commons - the most common base library stuff
  * ph-dao - file based DAO library with WAL support
  * ph-datetime - extension library for handling Java date and time special cases
  * ph-graph - generic graph library with directed and undirected graphs
  * ph-jaxb - the JAXB utility classes building upon ph-commons and ph-xml
  * ph-json - a generic simple JSON reader, visitor and writer
  * ph-less-commons - previously contained in ph-commons not really used but I was afraid to dump it :)
  * ph-matrix - a simple library for handling matrix data structures and operations
  * ph-scopes - based library for non-web related scope handling
  * ph-security - security related topics like key store handling, message digests etc
  * ph-settings - a small library for handling configuration files in an easy way
  * ph-tree - generic tree structures and tree singleton base classes
  * ph-xml - everything to read and write XML, including "MicroDOM" my personal minimum XML representation shipping with its own serializer.

## Contents

Note: to be updated for 9.x - this is for 8.x

In general I tried to make the source comments as useful as possible. Therefore here only an alphabetic package list with the respective contents is shown:

  * `com.helger.commons` - The base package that contains only a class with only constant values (`CGlobal`) and a programming utility class (`ValueEnforcer`). 
  * `com.helger.commons.aggregate` - contains a generic aggregator and multiple implementations that can aggregate multiple values to a single value.
  * `com.helger.commons.annotations` - contains all the Java annotations defined in this project. This include e.g. `@Nonempty`, `@ReturnsMutableCopy` or `@DevelopersNote`.
  * `com.helger.commons.base64` - contains the Base64 implementation from http://iharder.net/base64 in a slightly adopted version.
  * `com.helger.commons.cache` - defines generic interfaces and classes for caching data
  * `com.helger.commons.callback` - contains all kind of simple data structures that are to be used for callbacks and external exception handling. Additionally special forms of `Runnable` and `Callable` are present in this package.
  * `com.helger.commons.callback.adapter` - special adapter class implementations that can convert between `Callable`, `Runnable` etc.
  * `com.helger.commons.callback.exception` - special callback implementations to catch `Exception`s.
  * `com.helger.commons.changelog` - contains everything needed for having a structured change log (= history of changes) of software components. A complete list of all changes can be found in class `ChangeLog` containing multiple entries.
  * `com.helger.commons.charset` - contains stuff necessary for simple String character set/encoding and decoding as well as an enumeration for Unicode BOM (Byte Order Mark).
  * `com.helger.commons.cleanup` - contains a central class to cleanup and/or reset most of the runtime data and caches used in this project. This is especially helpful in unit tests when testing this project.
  * `com.helger.commons.codec` - contains a generic encode/decode interface and some basic implementations like ASCII85, ASCII Hex, DCT, Base64, LZW and RFC 1522. This package is based on `com.helger.commons.encode` package. 
  * `com.helger.commons.collation` - contains collation helper methods (`CollationHelper`). 
  * `com.helger.commons.collection` - contains very basic helper classes for easy working with arrays (class `ArrayHelper`) and collections (class `ContainerHelper`). It also contains a local implementation of `Stack` called `NonBlockingStack` which does not use synchronization - this can be seen like the different between `ArrayList` (not synchronized) and `Vector` (synchronized).
  * `com.helger.commons.collection.attr` - contains a generic attribute container which more or less is a `Map` with a modified API. This package contains both read-only as well as mutable versions of this map-based container.
